Man killed in Snowdonia fall named

The walker who fell to his death in Snowdonia on Sunday has been named as John Gerrard Wynne.

The 61-year-old had been walking on Tryfan with his daughter when he fell a "considerable distance" and died.

Mr Wynne is from Exmouth in east Devon.

A post mortem has been carried out into his death and an inquest will be held at a later date.

The man is then thought to have slipped and fallen during their ascent back up the gully, Christopher Lloyd of Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation said.

The victim, who had climbed Snowdon a day earlier during the weekend trip with his daughter, believed to be aged in her mid 20s, was spotted by a rock climber nearby and police were called shortly after midday.

Mr Lloyd described the mountain as "a challenge", and said their rescue service deals with at least two fatal incidents each year.
