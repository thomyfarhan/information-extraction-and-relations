The family of a 61-year-old Devon man who fell while walking the mountains in Wales and tragically died have paid tribute to the 'adored and beloved' family man.

John Wynne, 61, a finance director with Hawksmoor who lived in Exmouth, fell while walking in Snowdonia national park in Wales on Saturday.

John and his 23-year-old daughter had climbed Snowdon the day before and on Sunday were walking on Tryfan.

In a statement, the family today said: "John Wynne, an Exmouth man, aged 61, originally from Carlow, Ireland, adored his family and was a beloved husband, father and brother.

"He was enjoying a weekend walking in Snowdonia with his daughter when he tragically slipped and sustained serious injuries, passing away on Sunday, May 14, 2017. The family is devastated and shocked by this tragic accident.

"We are incredibly grateful to the Mountain Rescue, Coast Guard Ambulance Service, the North Wales Police, Bangor hospital and members of the public who helped at the scene. We are so thankful for all the prayers, love and support from wonderful family and friends who are also feeling such a great loss."
