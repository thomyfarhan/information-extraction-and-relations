Man dies after 'considerable' fall on Tryfan in Snowdonia

A man has died after a falling a "considerable" distance while walking on Tryfan mountain in Snowdonia.

The man, believed to be from Exeter and in his early 60s, fell in the North Gully, said North Wales Police who were alerted on Sunday.

He had been climbing with his daughter. The man was airlifted to hospital where he was declared dead.

"Our thoughts are with his family and friends," said PC Gethin Jones of North Wales Police.

Chris Lloyd of Ogwen Valley mountain rescue team said the pair had been walking in the area over the weekend when they took a wrong path down the mountain.

"It's very easy to take the wrong turning," he said.

"They realised it was steeper than they wanted and turned round when he slipped and fell."

A nearby rock climber raised the alarm and the rescue team called a Coastguard helicopter to take the man to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor while they guided his "distraught" daughter, aged in her 20s, down the mountain.
