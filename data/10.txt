Walker who died in Tryfan fall is named as John Wynne

The walker who died in a fall from Tryfan on Sunday has been named as John Gerard Wynne.

The 61-year-old, from Exmouth, Devon, was descending the mountain with his daughter when they got on to difficult steep ground.

Mr Wynne fell a considerable distance into a gully while the pair were trying to reach safety. Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation was called out and the Caernarfon Coastguard helicopter flew to the scene. A climber who was nearby and witnessed the walker’s fall tried to resuscitate him, and also consoled Mr Wynne’s daughter.

The walker was airlifted from the hospital but died of his injuries.

The chartered accountant was originally from Ireland, but had lived in Devon for 20 years. He was a director of the Open Door charity and was also involved with Christ Church, Woodbury.

Mr Wynne’s family said in a statement he adored his family and was a beloved husband, father and brother.

They said: “He was enjoying a weekend walking in Snowdonia with his daughter when he tragically slipped and sustained serious injuries, passing away on Sunday.

“The family is devastated and shocked by this tragic accident.

“We are incredibly grateful to the mountain rescue, Coastguard, ambulance service, the North Wales Police, Bangor hospital and members of the public who helped at the scene. We are so thankful for all the prayers, love and support from wonderful family and friends who are also feeling such a great loss.”
