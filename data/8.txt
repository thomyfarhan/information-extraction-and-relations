Tributes paid to Irishman who died after taking 'considerable' fall from Welsh mountain

Tributes have been paid to 61 year old Irishman who was killed after taking a wrong path on a Welsh mountain.

John Wynne, originally from Co Carlow and his daughter, who is in her 20s, had climbed Snowdon on Saturday and were walking in Snowdonia National Park on Sunday when the tragic accident happened.

The pair took a wrong path down the mountain and John slipped and fell a 'considerable distance' of around 200 feet.

Chris Lloyd, of Ogwen Valley mountain rescue, said the pair had been walking in the area on Tryfan mountain in Snowdonia over last weekend.

He said they took a wrong path down the mountain.

He said: "It's very easy to take the wrong turning. They realised it was steeper than they wanted and turned round when he slipped and fell.

"A nearby rock climber raised the alarm and John was flown to hospital at Bangor but did not survive. His distraught daughter had to be led down the mountain by rescuers.

John's devastated family, who live in Exmouth, Devon, said he 'tragically slipped and sustained serious injuries'.John was married with three children.

He was Head of Finance at Hawksmoor investment management in Exeter, Devon,where he started work in 2009.

Hawksmoor CEO John Crowley said:"We are devastated to lose such a valued and admired friend and colleague as John.

"His wise and experienced input from the very early days of Hawksmoor made a major contribution to the company's growth. He will be sorely missed and our hearts go out to his family at their untimely loss."

Colleagues said John, who spent most of his career working in financial services in Ireland, Bermuda and the UK, had a 'calm and congenial approach which made him universally popular'.
